# California Housing Price Prediction – Linear Regression Project  

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression** for predicting median house values in California districts.  
The goal is to practice implementing linear regression from scratch, evaluate performance, and compare results with Scikit-learn’s built-in model.  

---

## 🔹 Project Overview  
- Load the **California Housing dataset**  
- Split data into training and test sets  
- Standardize features for better convergence  
- Implement **Linear Regression from scratch** using the **Normal Equation**  
- Compute **RMSE** for both training and test data  
- Compare predictions with Scikit-learn’s Linear Regression implementation  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 📂 Project Structure  
- **pr2_melika_rezaye.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook with implementation  
- Dataset is loaded directly from **Scikit-learn** (`fetch_california_housing`)

## 📊 Results  

### 🔹 Linear Regression (from scratch)  
- Derived weights using the **Normal Equation**  
- Calculated **RMSE** on training and test sets  
- Predicted median house prices  

### 🔹 Scikit-learn Linear Regression  
- Used built-in implementation for comparison  
- Verified results against the scratch implementation
