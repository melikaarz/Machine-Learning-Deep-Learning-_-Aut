# 📈 Linear & Polynomial Regression Project  

This project demonstrates the implementation of both **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** using Python.  
The goal is to analyze model performance on training, validation, and test datasets, and to visualize how polynomial degree affects underfitting and overfitting.  

---

## 🔹 Project Overview  
- Load datasets (`train`, `valid`, `test`)  
- Implement **Linear Regression** from scratch  
- Extend the model to **Polynomial Regression** (degrees 1–10)  
- Compute **RMSE** for each model to compare training and validation errors  
- Visualize model predictions for both regression approaches

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Result 
🔹 Linear Regression
- Fits a straight line to the dataset
- Visualizes predictions on train, validation, and test sets

🔹 Polynomial Regression
- Fits polynomial curves of varying degrees (1–10)
- Computes RMSE for both training and validation data
- Demonstrates the tradeoff between underfitting (low degree) and overfitting (high degree)
